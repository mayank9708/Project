# Vulnerability Scanning Automation with CI/CD Integration

## Project Overview
This project automates vulnerability scanning for both web and network applications using OWASP ZAP and Nmap. It integrates these scanning tools into a CI/CD pipeline using Docker for containerization. 
The goal is to ensure that security tests are conducted automatically with every code commit and deployment. The project also includes a simple dashboard for reporting and visualizing vulnerabilities, 
along with DevSecOps practices to ensure secure infrastructure.
